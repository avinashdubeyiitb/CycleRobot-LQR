MODEL BASED ROBOT DESIGN


>>>>>> 1st WEEK

- Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum was designed and balanced in V-REP.
- To move closer to the design of cyclebot, reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum with a pivot point
  was designed and balanced in V-REP.
- Finally the design of the Cyclebot was made, it's mathematical modelling was done and it was balanced in V-REP.
- The Cyclebot was also made to follow a path.


>>>>>> 2nd WEEK

- Explanation videos about all of the topics metioned were made.
- Experiments were designed to help understand the topics in a more fun and practical way.


>>>>>> 3rd WEEK

- This week's work is divided into 3 videos and 2 experiments.
- All Documents and Videos have been Completed and uploaded


>>>>>> 4th WEEK

- This week's work is divided into 3 experiments.
- First 2 experiments have been completed and uploaded.
- 3rd experiment will be completed once the cyclebot is ready.


>>>>>> 5th WEEK

- This week we have to do total 5 explaining documents and code.
- Jai is working and making the Cyclebot hardware.
- The other two team members, Chinmaya and Shreya are completing the documentation and working on the code for the hardware.
