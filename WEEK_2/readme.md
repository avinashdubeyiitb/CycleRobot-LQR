# Introduction to State Space Representation
- This week's task involved making of explanation videos and experiments for the better understanding of concepts.
- The entire week's work was divided into 3 groups:
  1. Explanation of state space modelling and experiments based on that.
  2. Eigenvalues and Stability Criterion explanation and experiments.
  3. Controllability and Observability explanation and experiment based on it.
