# Non-Linear Systems and State-Space Modelling

- 3 experiments to be designed.
  1. Finding out Kinetic Energy of the System and Potential Energy of the system.
     Finding out Lagrangian of the System and Euler Lagrange equation.
  2. Jacobian and Linearizing the System.
     Finding out the Equilibrium Points and types of equilibrium.
  3. Equating them and finding out the Parametric State- Space Model.
     Substituting Practical Values and Checking for Controllability of the system.
