MODEL BASED ROBOT DESIGN


>>>>>> 1st WEEK

- Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum was designed and balanced in V-REP.
- To move closer to the design of cyclebot, reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum with a pivot point
  was designed and balanced in V-REP.
- Finally the design of the Cyclebot was made, it's mathematical modelling was done and it was balanced in V-REP.
- The Cyclebot was also made to follow a path.


>>>>>> 2nd WEEK

- Explanation videos about all of the topics metioned were made.
- Experiments were designed to help understand the topics in a more fun and practical way.
