>>>>>> 09/05/2020 Day 1

We had a team meeting, wherein we learned a little more about each other and discussed the following things.
1. We discussed the layout of our project and how we are going to work in the upcoming weeks.
2. It was decided that Chinmaya will handle the V-Rep and Jai and I will go through the research
   papers and do the mathematical modelling for the first week.
3. Discussion was also done regarding the design of our bot and it's structure.  
4. We then proceeded towards finding relevant research papers for our robot.
5. We also went through several videos to get ourselves familiarised with the cyclebot.

Task:

Mathematical modelling of Cyclebot

- We started with Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum system.
- This system closely resembles the Cyclebot system.
- I referred to various research papers that were relevant to the system.
- Finally found one extremely relevant.
  (https://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/144208/Kybernetika_51-2015-1_12.pdf)
- Referring to this paper I did the mathematical  modelling for Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum system.
- There were 4 state space variables chosen theta, theta dot, phi and phi dot.
- The state space representation of the system was found out complete with the A and B matrices.
- These will be further used in finding the K matrix for LQR controller.
- The next part of my work was related to octave. I read documentation about how to connect octave files with V-Rep.

Task:

- The Octave code for the generation of optimal state feedback control gain matrix K was written .
- A, the state matrix and B, the input matrix were written in the code from the derivation of the system.
- The constants like mass of the pendulum, mass of the wheel etc. were found out using Fusion 360 software where the model was made.
- Using the lqr() function in MATLAB the K matrix was generated.
- I also went through a tutorial on Lua programming in V-Rep.

>>>>>> 13/05/2020 Day 4

- Worked on the tuning of K matrix for balancing the Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum.
- Coordinated with the team, understood changes in the Lua script, and subsequent tuning and improvisation of algorithm. 
- Video of Simulation of stabilized Reaction wheel Inverted Pendulum on V-rep.

>>>>>> 14/05/2020 Day 5

- Made the document containing the Mathematical Modelling of Reaction wheel inverted pendulum on overleaf.
- The team had a discussion and we finalised the design of Cyclebot.
- Read and researched about the position of the reaction wheel on our bot.
- Saw videos and articles explaining the concept of angular momentum, torque, angular acceleration and center of gravity.



>>>>>> 15/05/2020 Day 6

- Had a meeting with our mentors where we showed them the system on a pivot simulation and the final design of the bot.
- Simulation of Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum connected via a pivot to the ground was done using V-Rep.
- The code for the same was created in Lua script on V-Rep.
- Saw videos about path planning in V-Rep for use in Cyclebot simulation.



>>>>>> 16/05/2020 Day 7

- Researched about possible ideas for next week’s work.
- Saw videos and read about the importance of control systems.
- Saw videos about the use and benefit of control systems.
- Thought about the experiments for 2nd week's tasks.



>>>>>> 18/05/2020 Day 8

- Had a meeting with our mentors where we presented the simulation of our Cyclebot.
- The task for the day included making a motivational and informative video about control systems.
- Made a document containing the entire layout and structure of the video.
- Started with making my part of the video.



>>>>>> 19/05/2020 Day 9

- I worked on the presentation for the video.
- Did some more research about the best way to make a motivational video.
- Coordinated with the team in improving the layout of the presentation.
- Wrote the content for the audio for my section of the video.



>>>>>> 20/05/2020 Day 10
