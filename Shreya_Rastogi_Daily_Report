>>>>>> 09/05/2020 Day 1

We had a team meeting, wherein we learned a little more about each other and discussed the following things.
1. We discussed the layout of our project and how we are going to work in the upcoming weeks.
2. It was decided that Chinmaya will handle the V-Rep and Jai and I will go through the research
   papers and do the mathematical modelling for the first week.
3. Discussion was also done regarding the design of our bot and it's structure.  
4. We then proceeded towards finding relevant research papers for our robot.
5. We also went through several videos to get ourselves familiarised with the cyclebot.

Task:

Mathematical modelling of Cyclebot

- We started with Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum system.
- This system closely resembles the Cyclebot system.
- I referred to various research papers that were relevant to the system.
- Finally found one extremely relevant.
  (https://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/144208/Kybernetika_51-2015-1_12.pdf)
- Referring to this paper I did the mathematical  modelling for Reaction wheel balanced inverted pendulum system.
- There were 4 state space variables chosen theta, theta dot, phi and phi dot.
- The state space representation of the system was found out complete with the A and B matrices.
- These will be further used in finding the K matrix for LQR controller.
- The next part of my work was related to octave. I read documentation about how to connect octave files with V-Rep.

>>>>>> 12/05/2020 Day 3

Task:

- The Octave code for the generation of optimal state feedback control gain matrix K was written .
- A, the state matrix and B, the input matrix were written in the code from the derivation of the system.
- The constants like mass of the pendulum, mass of the wheel etc. were found out using Fusion 360 software where the model was made.
- Using the lqr() function in MATLAB the K matrix was generated.
- I also went through a tutorial on Lua programming in V-Rep.
