# Optimal Control Strategy
We were supposed to design 4 experiments/explanatory documents for this week.
1. Defining LQR Control. Impact of Q and R matrix (LQR_CONTROL)
2. Implementing LQR Control in Octave (LQR_control_Octave)
3. Implementing the Feedback in Arduino. Tuning the Parameters. (sensors_and_tuning)
4. Strategy for Navigation Via Remote Control. Debugging the System.
