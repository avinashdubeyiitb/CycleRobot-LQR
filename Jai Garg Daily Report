>>>>>>>Cycle Bot Day 1<<<<<<<<<

We had a personal meeting with my teammates on discord to know each other better and to make a plan for working the project.
It was discussed that Chinmay will handle V-rep simulations whereas Shreya and Jai will read more research papers about the project and try to derive mathematical equations for the model. Jai will also help Chinmay in making the 3d models on fusion 360. 

New Things learned:
We read a number of papers on reaction wheel and cycle bot
We got familiar with V-rep Software
